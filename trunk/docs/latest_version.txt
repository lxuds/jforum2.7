<p>Some features have been added, changed or fixed in JForum 2.5.0, like:</p>

<li>updated C3P0 from 0.9.5.1 to 0.9.5.2</li>
<li>updated CSRFGuard from 3.0.0 to 3.1.0</li>
<li>updated JavaMail from 1.5.4 to 1.6.0</li>

<li>upgrade Microsoft SQL Server driver from 4.1 to 6.2.2-jre7</li>
<li>upgrade Oracle driver from ojdbc6 to ojdbc7</li>
<li>updated jQuery from 1.11.3 to 1.12.4</li>
<li>JForum now requires a Java 7 compatible JVM. Java 6 is long past its EOL, so this shouldn't be a big deal.</li>
<li>Mobile view: For the most commonly viewed pages, mobile views are available. Through the "Desktop view" and "Mobile view" links at the bottom of all pages it's possibly to switch between views. JForum tries to guess whether a mobile device is used upon first access, but you can always use those links to switch between views if it gets it wrong.</li>
<li>Wiki topics: These are topics that are more like a wiki page than a discussion - instead of replying to the first post, everyone can edit it, effectively keeping it up to date. After an edit, it'll be listed as a recent topic, and a notification mail will be sent (if requested) - similar to how regular topics are treated if a new reply is posted. A topic can be made a Wiki topic the same way it can be made "Sticky" or "Announce". Wherever the number of replies is shown, a "W" indicates that wiki topics do not have replies.</li>
<li>The Configurations page now has UI settings for various options which existed before, but weren't configurable via the admin panel (too many to list, just look through the Configurations page to see if there's anything that looks unfamiliar and useful :-) The Welcome HTML and Welcome Attribute settings now take effect immediately.</li>
<li>Reworked the social sharing buttons so they don't access an external site, and aren't loaded if social.enabled is set to false. Also pruned the list of sites that is supported, and removed obsolete ones. The selection of sites, and the order in which they're shown, can be configured in the admin panel.</li>
<li>The forum watch and topic watch links have been ajax-ified, so the page is no longer reloaded if a topic or forum is watched or unwatched.</li>
<li>Updated several Javadoc URLs</li>
<li>No longer finds the text inside the BB tags (like "quote") when searching for that term</li>
<li>XSS issues on the Configurations and Spam Blocking admin pages, and one resulting from an invalid email address, have been fixed</li>
<li>The URL from where the jQuery library is loaded can now be configured</li>
<li>Widen IP address fields to accommodate IPv6, and store user's IP address for private messages</li>
<li>Replaced obsolete links to GoogleCode with links to SourceForge</li>
<li>Better IP address extraction from the x-forwarded-for request header</li>
<li>[#42] Disable CAPTCHA for Administrators / Moderators</li>
<li>[#68] allow newer, longer gTLDs for email addresses</li>
<li>[#70] and [#73] fix interference of CSRF protection with multi-page topics; use csrfguard-3.1-latest.jar instead of the csrfguard jar that's in the war file</li>
<li>[#71] Wrong topic page when navigating from the page forums/list.page</li>
<li>[#72] YouTube <object> has been deprecated since January 2015</li>
<li>[#74] Small improvements to the author column of a topic page</li>
<li>[#75] Improvements to Russian localization</li>
<li>Bug fix: the settings for registration captcha and post captcha were not being used properly</li>
</ul>
