	<li>new configuration: <tt>lucene.analyzer.stopwords</tt> 	Comma-separated list containing zero or more of: ar, br, cz, de, en, fr, bg, bn, ca, cjk, ckb, da, el, es, eu, fa, fi, ga, gl, hi, hu, hy, id, it, lt, lv, nl, no, pt, ro, ru, sv, th, tr. Include all languages for which there is content in the forums; that will prevent stop words in those languages from being indexed for searching. The index needs to be recreated for this to take effect. Default is "en" because that's how it worked before. If you have content predominantly from one language, you may want to adjust both the lucene.analyzerand lucene.analyzer.stopwordsproperties to reflect that language.</li>
	<li>new configuration: <tt>dateTime.pretty</tt> Whether to show relative times like "1 hour ago", "1 day ago", "6 month ago" etc, or absolute times like "December 21, 2018". This replaces the dateTime.local property which is no longer supported.</li>
	<li>new configuration: <tt>mail.smtp.additional.properties</tt> A comma-separated list of additional SMTP properties to use when sending out mails. For example, adding mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true and mail.smtp.starttls.required=true would require TLS to be used.</li>
</ul>
